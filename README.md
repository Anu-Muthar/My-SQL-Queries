# My-SQL-Queries
My-SQL-Queries is a collection of SQL queries that I personally wrote while practicing and preparing for interviews. It includes real-world scenarios covering joins, aggregations, window functions, and more. I created this repository to keep my learnings organized and to showcase my SQL skills during interviews and future projects.
